# Change Request Template - CR-000

**CR Number:** CR-000  
**Title:** Improve User Login Performance

## 1. Feature Description / Issue Summary
- **What:** Optimize the user login process to reduce latency and enhance 
overall performance.
- **Where:** Authentication module, including API endpoints and session 
management.
- **When:** Scheduled for immediate implementation in the upcoming patch 
(v1.5.3).

## 2. Rationale
- **Why:** Current login times exceed acceptable thresholds, leading to 
decreased user satisfaction.
- **Benefits:** 
  - Faster login times and improved user retention.
  - Reduced server load and enhanced scalability.
  - Lowered support ticket volume regarding login issues.

## 3. Impact Analysis
- **Scope:** 
  - Affects all users on both web and mobile platforms.
  - Impacts the backend session management and authentication processes.
- **Risks:** 
  - Minor risk of regression in session management if not properly tested.
  - Potential temporary downtime during the deployment phase.
- **Dependencies:** 
  - Requires updates to the database query performance.
  - Needs integration with the updated session handling module.
- **Cost/Benefit:** 
  - Minimal development effort required.
  - Significant improvement in user experience and system performance.

## 4. Proposed Solution
- **Approach:**  
  - Conduct a performance audit to identify key bottlenecks in the current 
login flow.
  - Refactor the authentication code and optimize database queries.
  - Implement caching for session data where applicable.
  - Perform thorough regression and performance testing across devices.
- **Alternatives Considered:**  
  - Scaling hardware resources (rejected due to higher operational costs 
and only temporary relief).

## 5. Approvals
- **Requester:** Arsen Ogutu, Product Manager, 03/01/2025  
- **Technical Lead:** Brian Kogi, Lead Developer, 03/02/2025  
- **Project Manager:** Issene Halake, Project Manager, 03/03/2025

## 6. Additional Notes
- Monitoring tools will be configured post-deployment to track login 
performance improvements.
- A rollback plan is in place should any critical issues arise during the 
update.
